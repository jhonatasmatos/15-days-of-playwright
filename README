## 📖 Motivation

As modern web applications become increasingly complex, having reliable testing tools is crucial. Playwright emerged as a next-generation solution addressing pain points from older tools like Selenium and Cypress:

- **True cross-browser testing** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Auto-waiting** and **web-first assertions**
- **Mobile device emulation** out-of-the-box
- **Unified API** across all browsers

This project documents my 15-day journey mastering Playwright's capabilities while building practical test automation solutions.
